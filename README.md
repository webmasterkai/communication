Communication
=============

## Prefered methods of communication

1. Written letter.
1. Face to face.
1. Phone call. (Voicemail only for proof of call. Not for any communication about anything.)
1. Email.
2. SMS

## Response time to communication request based on method of request
The problem with the preferred methods of communication and the response time is that they do not allow for day-to-day operating and inquiry. Say I wanted to see if you would go to a play with me and i needed gto by tickets. Even with the most quick and easiest - according to your preferred, it would be 24 hrs delay. However, by the time you respond, the tickets/decision would have had to be made - and the cycle of poor communication continues. 

Furthermore, you did not put all the corresponding response times for your preferred methods. I have added and adjusted. 

* Written letter: 5 days
* Face-to-face: 20 minutes
* Phone call: 24 hours
* Email: 12 hours
* SMS: 12 hours

## Standard times

I don't understand this timing system - 1.5 and 2 hour durations?
* 900-1030
* 1800-2000

Overall, I think we need to make two types of communication modes: Logistics vs. Content. Logistics could have shorter response time and be more heavily frequent with certain modes and Content could follow more along your original outline. I did not enter this yet because I wanted you to read over my reaction to your first draft proposal. Let me know if you want to see what a two-type communication protocol would look like.
