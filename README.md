## Urgent Communication

The problem with the preferred methods of communication and the response time is that they do not allow for questions that need a quick response. A last minute invite to a play requires faster response.

For urgent communication the preferred methods are in reverse. It should be included in the communication that it is urgent and when the accelerated answer or help is needed.
